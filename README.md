## Notes
- This code was written in Python 2.7 for compatibility with Apache Spark.
- The large file size of the maps tends to cause problems when viewing on github or nbviewer, but the January to August 2016 map can be viewed [here](https://rawgit.com/aaronzira/earthquakes/master/map.html). It is a glaring contrast from the full-year 1985, 1995, and 2005 maps.
