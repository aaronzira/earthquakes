    "Having studied geology as an undergraduate, and having personally experienced seismic events of moment magnitudes [6.7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_Northridge_earthquake) and [9.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_T%C5%8Dhoku_earthquake_and_tsunami), the prospect of working with earthquake data was very enticing for me. Articles such as [this one](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/drilling-for-earthquakes/) from Scientific American highlight the dramatic increase in number of earthquakes in the Central US over the last few decades (as seen in the USGS image below), and their potential correlations with drilling operations in the area: \n",

    "The [USGS earthquake catalog](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/) seemed an excellent source of unbounded data that could be compared against static data on oil and gas wells to accomplish my goals. "

While Colorado and Oklahoma have columns of API codes that indicate the county in which the surface of a well is found, for Kansas there is only information on Township, which was not relevant to me.

    "I would like to port all the data to [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/), and take advantage of the performance, speed, and data types and structures available there, such as K-D trees and lat/long points. In addition, my distance calculations could be made more accurate using the [Haversine formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula), which determines great circle distances by taking into account the radius of the earth, instead of considering the area in question a 2-dimensional map. Getting more data is pretty much always a good idea, and it would be nice to have data on wells from many other states, especially all of those for which the USGS has established correlations between drilling and seismicity. \n",

    "Using the data created here, it would be interesting to apply machine learning techniques to determine if there are certain features (depth, well type, years active or inactive, direction, presence of other wells nearby, etc.) that contribute to a higher likelihood of induced seismicity in a particular area. In addition, data from a geologic map could be included to examine what types of rock are found in and around the areas of interest, potentially allowing for predictive applcations of future seismic activity related to wells anywhere.
